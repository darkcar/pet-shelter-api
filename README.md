# Pet Shelter API

## Description 

Behind the scenes service. Provide RESTFUL API for [Pet-weather-app](https://github.com/darkcar/pet-weather). There RESTful JSON API endpoints:

1. An index of Pets: GET: https://stormy-shore-87607.herokuapp.com/api/pets

2. Pet lookup by ID: GET: https://stormy-shore-87607.herokuapp.com/api/pets/:id

3. Pet Creation with proper error checking: POST: https://stormy-shore-87607.herokuapp.com/api/pets

## Framework

This is built onto ExpressJS. 

## In the end

1. Implement the basic functions, but there are still some I have to enhance afterwards. For example, managing postgres connections, formating the project structure which follows industrial standards like(MVC or MVP pattern) .

2. First time using postgres, I will have to look into more about the API to make the data secure.
